# Arduino library for LPD8806 [![Build Status](https://github.com/adafruit/LPD8806/workflows/Arduino%20Library%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adafruit/LPD8806/actions)[![Documentation](https://github.com/adafruit/ci-arduino/blob/master/assets/doxygen_badge.svg)](http://adafruit.github.io/LPD8806/html/index.html)

This Library was written for the LPD8806 PWM LED driver chips, strips and pixels.
But the LPD8803/LPD8809 will probably work too.
