# Arduino library for LPD8806 [![Build Status](https://github.com/adafruit/LPD8806/workflows/Arduino%20Library%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/adafruit/LPD8806/actions)

This Library was written for the LPD8806 PWM LED driver chips, strips and pixels.
But the LPD8803/LPD8809 will probably work too.
